I'm re-implementing the computational parts of my COSC3500 major project in Rust as a way to learn the language.
I don't think I can share the code I wrote for assessment publicly, but as I'm writing this Rust code nearly a year after, I think sharing this is okay.

Ideally these Rust executables would be drop-in replacements for the C++ ones, and would produce output that can be read by the Python visualisation and analysis code.
